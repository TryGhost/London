# London Fog

A customized, image-centric theme based on [London](https://github.com/TryGhost/London) for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). Made for publishers and portfolios with plenty of graphics to show off to the world.

# Development

London styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

The `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.

```bash
$ yarn zip
```
